# Project 2 & 3

_I have added all the reflection regarding the project here!_

## Reflection - Project 2

For this project, initially, I just took the restaurant data set and created an interface.

<!-- But nah, there was something i could sprinkle on top to make it look like something out of LV-426, I got weyland-yutani on board for this project! -->

I thought this could be a nice way to make a little fanfiction based on alien movies, so i just adapted the narrative as follows.


>*"A data analyst from Weyland-Yutani has found correlation between the occurance of different species in particular hotspots of the asteroid with the data gathered from the dysfunctional food inspection synthetics."*



## Reflection - project 3

I thought the category view had no feedback while changing between different categories, so I have added animation using **GSAP** that triggers every time user changes between them.

In particular I have added animations for the overall table and individual rows.

Checkout these functions from  [_template_category_new.js_](https://github.com/Bharathrico/inst630/blob/main/asst_2_restaurants/editable_js/template_category_new.js) , `categoryEntry()` , `categoryExit()` & `rowAnimation()`
